- `Async Await` Concurrency Libary used to Network Calls
- Caching Images using `NSCache`
-  For Navigation, new `Navigation Stack` was used
- Search Query debounced using `Combine`


## Improvement Areas

Due to Acadmics (as It is end to semester), I have taken some approaches that I would not personally take in Real Project.

- Pagination is not implemented, which I feel must be there.
- Random Color changing each time view gets reloaded
- Fetching Images more effectively
    - Showing `ProgressView` while loading and default image if fetch failed and trying again either clicking on image or Independently
- UI Could to improved
